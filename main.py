# The Starting, Stopping, and Stepping Arguments to range()
# for i in range(0, 10, 2):
#     print(i)
#
    # The range() function can also be called with three arguments. The first two arguments will be the start and stop
    # values, and the third will be the step argument. The step is the amount that the variable is increased by after each iteration.
    # So calling range(0, 10, 2) will count from zero to eight by intervals of two.


# Importing Modules
# A module in Python is like a toolbox that contains special tools (functions).
# Python comes with many such toolboxes â€” this is called the standard library.
#
# Examples:
#     math module â€” has math tools like square root, pi, etc.
#     random module â€” has tools to create random numbers.
#     time module â€” has tools to work with time and delays.

# Why Import a Module?
#     Before you use the tools in a module, you must open the toolbox â€” this is done using the import keyword.
#    Once imported, you can use all the functions inside it.
# For example :
# import random
# for i in range(5):
#     print(random.randint(1, 10))

# # Ending a Program Early with the sys.exit() Function
# import sys
#
# while True:
#     print('Type exit to exit.')
#     response = input()
#     if response == 'exit':
#         sys.exit()
#     print('You typed ' + response + '.')

# ðŸ”¹ Case 1: Using import sys + sys.exit()
# import sys
#
# while True:
#     response = input("Type 'exit' to quit: ")
#     if response == 'exit':
#         sys.exit()
#     print("You typed:", response)
#
# print("This will NOT run if sys.exit() is called.") # When the user types 'exit', sys.exit() immediately ends the whole program.
# This will never run â€” because the program completely stops.

#  Case 2: Using break instead of sys.exit()

# while True:
#     response = input("Type 'exit' to quit: ")
#     if response == 'exit':
#         break
#     print("You typed:", response)
#
# print("This WILL run after the loop ends.")
# When the user types 'exit', break will only stop the loop â€” not the entire program.
# This  does run, because the program keeps going after the loop ends.
