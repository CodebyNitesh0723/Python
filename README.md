# Python Projects 🐍

Welcome to my Python repository!

I am currently learning Python by following the book [*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart. It's a practical guide to learning Python by building scripts that automate everyday tasks.

This repository contains some of the projects and exercises I'm working on as I go through the book. It includes:

- Practice scripts
- Small automation tools
- Mini projects
- Notes and experiments

This is a learning journey, so the code might not always be perfect—but I'm improving every day!

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or share feedback. 😊
